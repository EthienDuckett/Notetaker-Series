this project was not a great idea but it has taught me something, I will probably discontinue it after I implement some more features

Possible upcoming features and estimated time of arrival:

~~'threading' - ETA: <3 days~~

polishing, buttons for user, hotkeys - ETA: >1 week (because of school)

coming up with a system that will implement HTML into the notes (this is only a possibility) - ETA: >1 week-never

loading notes from json file/auto-save

exporting notes to an actual format

option to make the background 'invisible' so you can see stuff when you write

custom protocol for sharing notes

protocol extended to update notes in real time - ETA: >6 weeks

better code base - ETA: not soon.

I am working on some other projects that are not related to coding as well, these projects take large amounts of 
time and I shouldn't ignore them for more than a day
